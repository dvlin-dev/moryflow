# Bug Hunter

Use this skill for code review requests.

## Workflow

1. Prioritize correctness, security, and regression risks.
2. Report concrete findings first, with file/line references.
3. Keep summary short and list residual risks explicitly.

## Output

- Findings ordered by severity.
- Open questions and assumptions.
- Brief change summary only after findings.
