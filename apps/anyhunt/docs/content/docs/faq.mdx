# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is Anyhunt?

Anyhunt is a web scraping API that extracts content from any webpage. You send a URL via our API, and we return clean, structured content in your preferred format (Markdown, HTML, links, or screenshots).

### What output formats are supported?

We support multiple output formats:
- **Markdown** - Clean, readable text (default)
- **HTML** - Cleaned HTML without scripts
- **Raw HTML** - Original unmodified HTML
- **Links** - All hyperlinks on the page
- **Screenshot** - Page capture in PNG, JPEG, or WebP

### How fast is the scraping?

Most scrapes complete in 2-5 seconds, depending on page complexity and network conditions. We wait for JavaScript to fully render before extracting content.

### Can I scrape pages that require login?

Currently, we support public pages only. Authenticated page scraping is on our roadmap.

## APIs

### What's the difference between Scrape and Crawl?

- **Scrape** - Extracts content from a single URL
- **Crawl** - Starts from a URL and follows links to scrape multiple pages, with depth control and path filtering

Use Scrape for individual pages. Use Crawl when you need content from an entire website or section.

### How does AI-powered extraction work?

The Extract API uses LLM (Large Language Model) to extract structured data from web pages. You provide a JSON Schema defining the data structure you want, and we return data matching that schema. Perfect for extracting product info, article metadata, or any custom data.

### How do Page Actions work?

Page Actions let you interact with a page before scraping. You can:
- **click** - Click elements (e.g., "Load More" buttons)
- **type** - Enter text into inputs
- **scroll** - Scroll the page
- **wait** - Wait for elements or time
- **press** - Press keyboard keys

This is useful for SPAs and pages with lazy-loaded content.

### What is the Map API for?

The Map API discovers all URLs on a website. It first tries to parse the sitemap (`/sitemap.xml`), and falls back to browser-based crawling if unavailable. Great for understanding site structure before crawling.

## Technical

### What browser do you use?

We use Chromium via Playwright for consistent, high-fidelity rendering that matches what users see in Chrome.

### Do you execute JavaScript?

Yes, JavaScript is fully executed. We wait for the page to be fully loaded and rendered before extracting content.

### What's the maximum page height for screenshots?

Full-page screenshots can capture up to 16,384 pixels in height.

### How does caching work?

Responses are cached for 1 hour by default. Cache keys are computed from `SHA256(url + options)`, so identical requests return cached results. Cache hits are indicated by `fromCache: true` and don't count against your quota.

### How is main content extracted?

We use Mozilla's Readability algorithm (same as Firefox Reader View) to identify and extract main content, filtering out navigation, ads, and other clutter. You can disable this with `onlyMainContent: false` to get the full page content.

## Security

### Is my API key secure?

API keys are stored as SHA256 hashes. The plaintext key is only shown once during creation. Always store keys securely and never expose them in client-side code.

### What SSRF protections do you have?

We block all requests to:
- Private IP ranges (10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, etc.)
- Localhost and loopback addresses
- Cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.x.x)
- Internal DNS names

### Where is my data stored?

Scraped content is cached on Cloudflare R2 and served via Cloudflare's global CDN. Data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Screenshots expire after the configured TTL.

## Billing

### How does billing work?

You're billed monthly based on your plan. Each API call consumes credits from your quota. Cache hits don't count against your quota.

### What payment methods do you accept?

We accept all major credit cards via our payment processor, Creem.

### Can I get a refund?

Monthly subscriptions are non-refundable but you can cancel anytime. Unused pay-as-you-go credits can be refunded within 30 days.

### Do you offer invoices?

Yes, invoices are automatically generated and available in your console under Billing.
