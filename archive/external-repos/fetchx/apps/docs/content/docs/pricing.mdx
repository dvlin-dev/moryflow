4. **Failed Requests** - Failed requests are automatically refunded

## FAQ

### What happens when I hit my quota?

If you have pay-as-you-go credits, those will be used. Otherwise, API requests will return a `429 QUOTA_EXCEEDED` error until your quota resets.

### Can I upgrade mid-cycle?

Yes! When you upgrade, you immediately get the new plan's quota (prorated). Your billing date stays the same.

### Do you offer annual plans?

Yes, annual plans save 20%. Contact us at support@aiget.dev for annual billing.

### Is there an enterprise plan?

For high-volume needs or custom requirements, contact us at enterprise@aiget.dev.
