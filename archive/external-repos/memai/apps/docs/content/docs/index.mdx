# Introduction

Memai is a **Memory as a Service** platform that provides semantic memory storage and retrieval APIs for AI applications. Enable your AI agents with long-term memory capabilities, vector-based semantic search, entity extraction, and knowledge graphs.

## What is Memai?

Memai allows AI applications to:

- **Store memories** - Persist conversations, facts, and context with automatic vector embeddings
- **Search semantically** - Find relevant memories using natural language queries
- **Extract entities** - Automatically identify and track people, places, and concepts
- **Build relationships** - Create knowledge graphs connecting entities

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Semantic Search** | Vector-based similarity search using state-of-the-art embeddings |
| **Entity Extraction** | Automatic identification of entities from memory content |
| **Relationship Graphs** | Connect entities with typed relationships |
| **Webhooks** | Real-time notifications for memory events |
| **Multi-tenant** | Isolated data per API key |

## Use Cases

### AI Assistants
Give your AI assistants the ability to remember past conversations, user preferences, and learned facts.

### Customer Support
Build support bots that remember customer history and context across sessions.

### Knowledge Management
Create searchable knowledge bases with semantic understanding.

### Research Tools
Build research assistants that can store and retrieve information contextually.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Create a memory
curl -X POST https://api.memai.dev/v1/memories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mm_your_api_key" \
