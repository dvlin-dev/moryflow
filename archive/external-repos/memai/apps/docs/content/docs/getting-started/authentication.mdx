# Authentication

All Memai API requests require authentication using an API key.

## API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate requests to the Memai API. Each API key:

- Starts with the prefix `mm_`
- Is associated with your account
- Has its own quota and rate limits
- Provides isolated data access

## Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to the [Memai Console](https://console.memai.dev)
2. Navigate to **API Keys** in the sidebar
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Give your key a descriptive name
5. Copy the key immediately

> **Security Note**: Your API key is only displayed once at creation. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new one.

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.memai.dev/v1/memories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mm_your_api_key"
```

### Header Format

```
Authorization: Bearer mm_your_api_key
```

## Security Best Practices

### Keep Keys Secret

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables to store keys
- Don't share keys in public forums or documentation

```bash
# Good: Use environment variables
export MEMAI_API_KEY="mm_your_api_key"
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MEMAI_API_KEY" ...
```

### Rotate Keys Regularly

- Create new keys periodically
- Delete old keys after transitioning to new ones
- Monitor key usage in the console

### Use Separate Keys for Environments

- Create different keys for development, staging, and production
- This makes it easier to track usage and revoke access if needed

## Managing API Keys

### View Keys

In the Console, go to **API Keys** to see all your keys with:

- Key name
- Creation date
- Last used timestamp
- Status (active/revoked)

### Revoke Keys

If a key is compromised:

1. Go to **API Keys** in the Console
2. Find the compromised key
3. Click the **Delete** button
4. Confirm deletion

The key is immediately invalidated and cannot be used for future requests.

## Error Responses

### Missing Authorization Header

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "Authorization header is required"
  }
}
```

### Invalid API Key

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_API_KEY",
    "message": "The provided API key is invalid"
  }
}
```

### Revoked API Key

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "API_KEY_REVOKED",
    "message": "This API key has been revoked"
  }
}
```
