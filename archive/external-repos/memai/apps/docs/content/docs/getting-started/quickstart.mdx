# Quickstart

This guide will walk you through creating your first memory and searching for it using the Memai API.

## Step 1: Get Your API Key

1. Sign up or log in at [console.memai.dev](https://console.memai.dev)
2. Navigate to **API Keys** in the sidebar
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy your API key (it starts with `mm_`)

> **Important**: Your API key is only shown once. Store it securely.

## Step 2: Create Your First Memory

Use the following curl command to create a memory:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.memai.dev/v1/memories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mm_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "John is a software engineer who loves TypeScript and React",
    "userId": "user_123",
    "tags": ["profile", "skills"]
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "mem_abc123",
  "content": "John is a software engineer who loves TypeScript and React",
  "userId": "user_123",
  "tags": ["profile", "skills"],
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Step 3: Add More Memories

Let's add a few more memories to make searching interesting:

```bash
# Memory about preferences
curl -X POST https://api.memai.dev/v1/memories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mm_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "John prefers dark mode and uses VS Code as his IDE",
    "userId": "user_123",
    "tags": ["preferences"]
  }'

# Memory about a conversation
curl -X POST https://api.memai.dev/v1/memories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mm_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "John mentioned he is working on a new e-commerce project using Next.js",
    "userId": "user_123",
    "tags": ["project", "conversation"]
  }'
```

## Step 4: Search Memories

Now let's search for relevant memories using natural language:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.memai.dev/v1/memories/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mm_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What programming languages does John know?",
    "userId": "user_123",
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "mem_abc123",
      "content": "John is a software engineer who loves TypeScript and React",
      "score": 0.89,
      "userId": "user_123",
      "tags": ["profile", "skills"],
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "mem_def456",
      "content": "John mentioned he is working on a new e-commerce project using Next.js",
      "score": 0.72,
      "userId": "user_123",
      "tags": ["project", "conversation"],
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:32:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

The search uses semantic similarity, so it finds relevant memories even when the exact words don't match.

## Step 5: List Memories

You can also list all memories for a user:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.memai.dev/v1/memories?userId=user_123&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mm_your_api_key"
```
